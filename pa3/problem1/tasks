Write a program, which verifies whether C, C++ and Java implementations of the Markov chain algorithm 
generate the same output, if they operate on the same input document and use the same random numbers 
in the process of selecting random suffixes. Make sure to take into account the fact that C++ and Java 
implementations place suffixes at the end of the suffix vector and the C implementation at the 
beginning of the suffix list.
