Implement Flight class in Python (problem 4 of programming assignment 2). Design and run systematic 
tests of your Flight class. Follow the guidelines of paragraphs 6.2-6.5 of the textbook. Provide a 
detailed description of all tests you have performed. Include a test, which stores in a file all data 
of an object representing a single flight, locates these data in the original input file and verifies 
whether they are identical.
