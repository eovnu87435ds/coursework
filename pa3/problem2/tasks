Write a Python implementation of the Markov chain algorithm. Add testing code to it, which verifies 
that every prefix obtained during the generate phase also occurred during the build phase. During the 
build phase create a data structure consisting of all prefixes occurring during the reading of the 
text document. During the generate phase verify that every prefix obtained in the iteration process 
was also placed in the data structure you created during the build phase.
